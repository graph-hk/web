This book offers a new interpretation of popular protests in Hong Kong since 1997, when Britain handed its sovereignty over the territory to China. While most academic and journalistic accounts call these movements for democracy and freedom, I argue that the totality of people’s demands and aspirations over two decades actually amounted to a decolonization struggle against the legacies and realities of British and Chinese colonialisms respectively. A central question this talk addresses is: how and why did ordinary citizens transform themselves from complacent colonized subjects to rebellious agents of history?

<img align="right" src="{{site.baseurl | prepend: site.url}}images/picSpeakerLeeChingKwan.jpg" alt="speaker" width="150"/> [Ching Kwan Lee](https://soc.ucla.edu/person/ching-kwan-lee/){:target="_blank"} is Professor of Sociology at UCLA interested in global and comparative issues: labor, political sociology, global development, decolonization, comparative ethnography, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Africa and the global south. She published three multiple award-winning monographs on contemporary China, forming a trilogy of Chinese capitalism through the lens of labor politics. Gender and the South China Miracle: Two Worlds of Factory Women (California 1998) documents the organization of gender and work in factory regimes in Hong Kong and Shenzhen when South China first emerged as the workshop of the world. Against the Law: Labor Protests in China’s Rustbelt and Sunbelt (California 2007) chronicles the unmaking and making of the Chinese working class in two regional economies experiencing the death of socialism and the rise of capitalism respectively in one country. The Specter of Global China: Politics, Labor, and Foreign Investment in Africa (Chicago 2017) follows the footsteps of Chinese state capital to Zambia and compares its relations with African state and labor to global private capital.

Her most recent publications turn to resistance to global China, especially mass mobilizations in Hong Kong. They include a monograph on Hong Kong’s decolonization struggle against both British and Chinese colonialism, titled Forever Hong Kong: A Global City’s Decolonization Struggle (Harvard, 2025), a short format book titled Hong Kong: Global China’s Restive Frontier (Cambridge 2022), and a co-edited volume on the 2014 Umbrella Movement: Take Back Our Future: an Eventful Sociology of the Hong Kong Umbrella Movement (Cornell, 2019).
