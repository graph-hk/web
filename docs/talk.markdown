In the post-NSL era, the struggle for Hong Kong’s political identity has shifted profoundly to the digital sphere and the transnational diaspora. This talk synthesizes findings from two recent studies—"Two Nationalisms, One City" and "'Revolution of Our Times'"—to map the discursive construction of a "stateless nation" across the UK, Canada, and Australia. Adopting an innovative mixed-methods framework that integrates the Discourse-Historical Approach (DHA) with Corpus-Assisted Discourse Studies (CADS), I analyse a purpose-built corpus of official government texts and diasporic social media posts. The presentation demonstrates how the state employs a "securitization" lexicon to criminalize dissent , while the diaspora re-signifies banned slogans into the "symbolic infrastructure" of a resilient civic nationalism. Crucially, this session addresses the methodological challenges of the field, detailing data collection strategies and the use of statistical metrics to empirically ground critical discourse analysis in a contested political terrain.

His research interrogates the (digital) construction of stateless nationalism and collective memory within the global Hong Kong diaspora. Adopting a Corpus-Assisted Discourse Studies (CADS) framework, his dissertation investigates how diasporic communities in the UK, Canada, and Australia construct a “stateless nation” through the symbolic infrastructure of language, memory, and cultural practice. His recent work includes “Two Nationalisms, One City: Official and Diasporic Framings of the 2019 Hong Kong Protests” and “‘Revolution of Our Times’: Stateless Nationalism and the Work of Slogans in the Hong Kong Diaspora,” both published in Nations and Nationalism.

He completed his PhD in Sociology at the University of Edinburgh. His dissertation, titled “The Rise of Hong Kong Nationalism on the Edge of Empires,” was supervised by Ross Bond and Michael Rosie. His interdisciplinary research integrates sociological theories of nationalism with computational techniques from computer science.
