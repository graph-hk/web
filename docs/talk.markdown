In the post-NSL era, the struggle for Hong Kong’s identity has migrated from physical space to the discursive realm. This seminar presents my recent study, Two Nationalisms, One City, to map the collision between two incompatible nationalisms: the state’s project of “organized forgetting” and the diaspora’s “radical remembrance.” I analyze how the government employs a lexicon of “securitization” and “rehabilitation” to pathologize dissent, reframing the 2019 protests as a social disease rather than a political awakening. In stark contrast, I demonstrate how the diaspora constructs a “stateless nation” through a “symbolic infrastructure” of resistance. By reclaiming terms like “comrades” (手足) and redefining “security” as human sanctuary rather than regime survival, the diaspora sustains a political community bound by affective solidarity. I contend that text has become the primary site of political agency, positioning the diaspora as the indispensable custodians of Hong Kong’s political soul.

His research interrogates the (digital) construction of stateless nationalism and collective memory within the global Hong Kong diaspora. Adopting a Corpus-Assisted Discourse Studies (CADS) framework, his dissertation investigates how diasporic communities in the UK, Canada, and Australia construct a “stateless nation” through the symbolic infrastructure of language, memory, and cultural practice. His recent work includes “Two Nationalisms, One City: Official and Diasporic Framings of the 2019 Hong Kong Protests” and “‘Revolution of Our Times’: Stateless Nationalism and the Work of Slogans in the Hong Kong Diaspora,” both published in Nations and Nationalism.
