**[Dr. Stan Hok-Wui Wong](https://stanhwwong.github.io/stanhwwong/){:target="_blank"}** is the coordinator of GRAPH. He has written extensively on Hong Kong politics and society. His previous works touch on issues such as electoral politics and state-business relations. In particular, his book, entitled *Electoral Politics in Post-1997 Hong Kong: Protest, Patronage, and the Media*, provides a parsimonious explanation for the waning electoral performance of the prodemocracy opposition parties, despite the public’s unwavering support for democratization. He is also a member of the research teams for the Asian Barometer Survey (ABS) and the World Values Survey (WVS) in Hong Kong. His works have been published in journals such as the *British Journal of Political Science*, *China Quarterly*, *Electoral Studies*, *Journal of Peace Research*, and *Political Behavior*.

Her research interests include transnational contentious politics, social movement, diasporas politics, party organization, participatory institutions, and public opinion. Dr. Shum is currently working on research projects focusing on how Hong Kong diasporas (re)construct their collective identity abroad, and how they navigate between the concerns of the homeland and their well-being in the host country such as the US. Her academic works have been published or accepted in *Journal of Asian and African Studies*, and *Japanese Journal of Political Science*, and her policy writings on Hong Kong can be found in the *Monkey Cage* in the Washington Post, *Mischiefs of Faction*, and the *Diplomat*. In addition, she pens the *Freedom of the World* report on Hong Kong, and serves as the country expert on Hong Kong in the *Varieties of Democracy* (V-Dem).
